          <h2>HILLARY CLINTON'S MANDATE PROBLEM</h2>
          <h4><blockquote>BY RYAN LIZZA</blockquote></h4>
        <div class="row">
          <p>The journalist Jonathan Rauch once noted that politicians whose public careers have lasted more than fourteen years rarely make it to the White House, unless they reach the Vice-Presidency by the fourteen-year mark. Lyndon Johnson, who served twenty-three years in Congress before becoming Vice-President, is the one exception since the turn of the century. Clinton was first elected to the Senate sixteen years ago, and if you count her time as First Lady she's been in public service for twenty-four years. (If you add her years as First Lady of Arkansas, the total is thirty-eight.)

          <p>Her many years in the public sphere have an obvious upside. She will be, arguably, the most experienced person ever to win the Presidency, and certainly the only one to bring a successful and popular former President with her to the White House. But her decades of experience come with a cost: the accumulated grievances of many political opponents and a large percentage of voters who hold unfavorable views about her. These are nearly impossible to change. On Monday night, the person whom Clinton would succeed tried to explain this phenomenon. "A lot of this just has to do with the fact that she has been in the trenches, in the arena, for thirty years," Barack Obama said when Jimmy Kimmel asked him why voters don't trust Clinton. "And when you have been in the public eye that long, and in politics, folks go after you and they're trying to find a weak spot, and any mistake that you make ends up being magnified, and ginned up, and there are commercials around it, and a whole narrative begins to build. You know that has an impact on people."
          </p>

          <div class="row">
          <p>All of this adds up to a serious problem for Clinton in 2017. She will, of course, be the first woman to win the Presidency, a historic milestone that should be cause for some bipartisan celebration. But her honeymoon period is not likely to last. Her Republican opponents will quickly argue that her election was not a referendum on her immigration-reform plan, her infrastructure spending ideas, or her childcare and family-leave proposals, three legislative priorities she is likely to push during her first year in office. The campaign, they will claim, was simply a rejection of Trump. If Republicans control both chambers of Congress, their argument that Clinton lacks a strong mandate will be even more powerful: while Americans may have given her the White House, they also voted for congressional Republicans to serve as a brake on her agenda.
