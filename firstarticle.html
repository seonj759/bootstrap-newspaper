          <h2>HOW THE DEMOCRATS BECAME THE PARTY OF THE UNIVERSITY</h2>
          <h4><blockquote>BY BENJAMIN WALLACE-WELLS</blockquote></h4>
        <div class="row">
          <p>The idea of the university has carried a weight in this campaign which it doesn't ordinarily hold. The most significant demographic change appears to be a clearer sorting by education among white voters, with white Americans with college degrees, for the first time in recent history, lining up behind the Democrat. At St. Anselm, Warren and Clinton at times seemed to be practicing an identity politics of the educated. "We believe in science!" Warren said, to loud applause. Part of Warren's talent is her sensitivity to the power of her own biography, and she tends to emphasize the role that higher education played in her steep ascent. "As I see it, I am the daughter of a maintenance man who became a United States senator," she said. Warren's break, in this tale, came in the form of cheap tuition at "a commuter college," which allowed her to finish her college degree years after she had dropped out to get married. Warren tried to wrap Clinton into this story: "She is the daughter of a factory worker who will become the President of the United States!" Warren cried. Then she realized her overreach. "Granddaughter, she said.

          <p>Warren is well known for being a more emphatic speaker than Clinton. Her signature gesture is a raised, clenched fist, and when a crowd applauds one of her lines she often shouts out "Yes!" On Monday, when Warren praised the Presidential nominee, seated next to the lectern, she took a long step toward Clinton, and shook a happy fist in her face. When the two women hugged, Warren, who is quite a bit taller, enveloped Clinton vertically. "She gets under his"-Trump's-"skin like no one else," Clinton said. "Some of the best TV you can see is on C-span when Elizabeth Warren is going after a bank president." That behavior is not entirely favorable to Clinton. As Annie Karni, of Politico, has noted, when Warren said, in an August speech, that our economy should not be left to "Morgan Stanley or Black Rock or Citigroup," she was speaking about banks that employed close Clinton allies, and signalling the fights to come over the makeup of the next Administration.

          <div class="row">
          <p>These two politicians want the same thing right now and different things in the future. It is not a coincidence that the first major policy accommodation that Clinton made to her party's left was about higher education. During the primary campaign, Bernie Sanders often asked the crowds at his rallies who had the largest amount of student debt, and people would call out their totals, each one higher than the last, until someone named an almost unimaginable sum, usually several hundred thousand dollars. This call-and-response deepened his supporters' conviction that the middle class had become economic victims. The policy that Sanders proposed, free college for all, was so ambitious that it partly served just to remind his voters of the narrowness of the Washington imagination, of the gap between what could be and what was.
