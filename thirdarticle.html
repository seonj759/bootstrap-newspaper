          <h2>TRUMP'S POST-FACTUAL WORLD</h2>
          <h4><blockquote>BY JON LEE ANDERSON</blockquote></h4>
        <div class="row">
          <p>The little boy listened to him with the rapt attention and guileless reverence of most children of that age. I decided not to argue, for his sake, but I was unsettled by the exchange. It was my first encounter in the United States with what we now refer to as the post-factual world. This was before Donald Trump began spearheading his own "birther" campaign against Obama by questioning his identity as an American citizen, and before the virulently anti-Obama Tea Party movement found a champion in Sarah Palin, who became a national figure following her selection as the running mate of the 2008 Republican nominee, John McCain. How could an otherwise ordinary-seeming citizen reject the known facts? Was it a willful mendacity borne out of prejudice, or something else?
          </p>
          </div>
          <div class="row">
          <p>The same reasoning prevailed in the anti-American conspiracy theories that had been circulating in the region for some time. They included the widespread belief that Osama bin Laden had been a C.I.A. asset, and that "the Jews," not Al Qaeda, had carried out the 9/11 attacks. All of the world's evil emanated from the same source: the United States, its government, and an opaque cabal that was said to include all the usual suspects-the bankers, the Jews, and so forth. The United Nations and the International Monetary Fund were often included in this nefarious grab bag as well. The sudden shock of the 2008 global crisis, followed as it was by the first African-American President moving into the White House, merely spread such toxic world views, it seems.

          <p>Trump picked up where Palin, in her new existence as a cable-TV host, trailed off. But he has managed to go much further. Beginning with his birther campaign against Obama, and carrying on with his misogynistic crusade against Clinton, Trump claimed leadership of the angry white American people's revolt and, incredibly, also won over a constituency for his Republican Presidential candidacy. We have all watched as he has thrust himself onto the main stage of the American political arena, and managed to dominate it for most of this past year. We have also watched him crash and burn in the Presidential debates. Now, with his popularity plunging in the polls, he seems to have decided to burn down the house and bring everybody with him.
